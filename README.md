# imgprocessing
Just some image processing homework.
There's 6 homework, 5 processing algorithm, will be finished after the last work.

Homework 1: read/write image files
1.	Please write a program which can read and write image files with different format. Compile it to an execution file named “HW1student_number.exe.”
2.	The program should read JPG files, BMP files, and PPM files.
3.	The program could write any one of the image file formats, including JPG, BMP, or PPM.
4.	The programming language and compiler should be C, C++, Python, or JAVA

Homework 2: Image histogram
1.  Please write a function which can show the histogram of an image through extended Homework 1. Compile it to an execution file named “HW2student_number.exe.”
2.  The direction of the histogram can be vertical or horizontal. The following example is vertical.
3.  The marks (or values) of the x-axis and y-axis can be omitted.

Homework 3: Generation of additive, zero mean Gaussian noise
1.	Please add a new function which can generate additive, zero mean Gaussian noises in HW2. Compile it to an execution file named “HW3student_number.exe.”
2.	The program code should exactly follow “Algorithm 2.3: Generation of additive, zero mean Gaussian noise” on page 35 (Chapter 3 PPT file) and be coded by yourself.
3.	The inputs of the program are the original image and the variance (or standard deviation) of the Gaussian noise. The outputs should include the noisy image and the histogram of Gaussian noise.

Extra 1: Image cut
