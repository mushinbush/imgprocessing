# imgprocessing
Just some image processing homework.
There's 7 homework, 6 processing algorithm, will be finished after the last work.

Homework 1: read/write image files
1.	Please write a program which can read and write image files with different format. Compile it to an execution file named “HW1student_number.exe.”
2.	The program should read JPG files, BMP files, and PPM files.
3.	The program could write any one of the image file formats, including JPG, BMP, or PPM.
4.	The programming language and compiler should be C, C++, Python, or JAVA

Homework 2: Image histogram
1.  Please write a function which can show the histogram of an image through extended Homework 1. Compile it to an execution file named “HW2student_number.exe.”
2.  The direction of the histogram can be vertical or horizontal. The following example is vertical.
3.  The marks (or values) of the x-axis and y-axis can be omitted.

Homework 3: Generation of additive, zero mean Gaussian noise
1.	Please add a new function which can generate additive, zero mean Gaussian noises in HW2. Compile it to an execution file named “HW3student_number.exe.”
2.	The program code should exactly follow “Algorithm 2.3: Generation of additive, zero mean Gaussian noise” on page 35 (Chapter 3 PPT file) and be coded by yourself.
3.	The inputs of the program are the original image and the variance (or standard deviation) of the Gaussian noise. The outputs should include the noisy image and the histogram of Gaussian noise.

Homework 4: Discrete wavelet transform
1.	Please add a new function which can process discrete wavelet transform. Compile it to an execution file named “HW4student_number.exe.”
2.	The input image should be translated into gray-level image, and the output image is the wavelet transform results. This wavelet transform function should be coded by yourself.
3.	You should implement at least one kind of wavelet transform, and let users determine the number of iterations. The mother wavelets include Harr wavelet, Meyer wavelet, Morlet wavelet, and so on. (The simplest method can refer to page 16 in AIPChapter03-3.pptx.)

Homework 5: Histogram equalization
1.	Please add a new function which can do histogram equalization in HW3. Compile it to an execution file named “HW5student_number.exe.”
2.	The program code should exactly follow “Algorithm 5.1 Histogram equalization” on page 13 (Chapter 5-1 PPT file) and be coded by yourself.
3.	The inputs of the function are the gray-level image. The outputs should include the results of histogram equalization and their corresponding histograms.

Extra 1: Image cut
